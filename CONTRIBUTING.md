# Contributing guidelines

Anyone and everyone is welcome to add content into this guide. Please follow these guidelines to make merging your PR easier:

- Your content piece should be added into the table under the appropriate header in the README.md. If no header matches your content, feel free to create one
- You are welcome to add your name, pseudonym, GitHub username, Discord username, YouTube channel name, or anything you wish. You can also leave it anonymous
- Please only add **one** single piece of content per PR
- The pull request title should include the content name and Issue number if applicable
- Your content must be approved by the Hyperlane team to quality for rewards

## Picking an Issue or adding your own

**You do not have to pick up an existing issue or create one before opening a PR**. However, we recommend doing this so you can be sure your content is something we are looking for before you spend a load of time on it ðŸ™‚

- Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-content/issues) to see some content that Hyperlane or other developers have suggested
- Anything with the `Ready to go` label can be picked up
- Create your own Issue if you have an idea for content
- In the Issue, please include Content Title, Description, and Recommended Type (e.g. article, video)
- Someone from the Hyperlane team will add the `Ready to go` label to your Issue if it is something weâ€™d love to see created
- When you start working on an Issue, please put a comment so no-one else picks it up

## Opening a PR

Please use the PR template which includes
- Content name
- Content type
- Content link
- Comments
- Your wallet address for rewards (if approved)

## Approval Process
Although we love as much content as possible, this will be a trusted guide for developers so we can only merge PRs that meet a quality standard. We'll be following this process:
- You open a PR with your new content following these guidelines
- Hyperlane will mark your PR with the `In review` label
- Someone from the Hyperlane team might make some comments or request edits to your content, and approve/decline within 5 days
- Once confirmed, the PR will be merged!
