# Contributing guidelines
> âš¡ Please note that although we encourage everyone to contribute, only approved content will qualify for rewards

Anyone and everyone is welcome to add content into this guide. Please follow these guidelines to make merging your PR easier:

- Your content piece should be added into the table under the appropriate header in the README.md. If no header matches your content, feel free to create one
- You are welcome to add your name, pseudonym, GitHub username, Discord username, YouTube channel name, or anything you wish. You can also leave it anonymous
- Please only add **one** single piece of content per PR
- The pull request title should include the content name and Issue number if applicable
- Your content must be approved by the Hyperlane team to quality for rewards

## Picking an Issue or adding your own

**You do not have to pick up an existing issue or create one before opening a PR**. However, we recommend doing this so you can be sure your content is something we are looking for before you spend a load of time on it ðŸ™‚

- Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-content/issues) to see some content that Hyperlane or other developers have suggested
- Anything with the `Ready to go` label can be picked up
- Create your own Issue if you have an idea for content
- In the Issue, please include Content Title, Description, and Recommended Type (e.g. article, video)
- Someone from the Hyperlane team will add the `Ready to go` label to your Issue if it is something weâ€™d love to see created
- When you start working on an Issue, please put a comment so no-one else picks it up

## Opening a PR

Please use the PR template which includes
- Content name
- Content type

## Approval Process
You will qualify for rewards if your content is approved by the Hyperlane team. This is our approval process:

- Once all comments are addressed, the content will be approved or declined within 5 days
- We will add a comment to let you know it is approved or declined and what reward(s) you qualify for. If applicable, we will confirm with you how you'd like to receive the token rewards
- Once confirmed, the PR will be merged and tokens sent. We will comment the transaction information
